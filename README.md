> # History of Tesla 

* ### Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, two Silicon Valley engineers, created the business in 2003 with the goal of demonstrating that "electric vehicles may be better, quicker, and more exciting to drive than gasoline cars."
* ### In order to create a powerful, gorgeous, and emission-free electric vehicle, Tesla was formally incorporated in 2003.
* ### Elon Musk has established himself as the face of Tesla and is sometimes mistaken for its founder. Musk is a Canadian-American who was born in South Africa and has engineering training. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a double bachelor of science degree in economics and physics.
* ### Nevertheless, at his core, he is an inventor and businessman. Musk enrolled in Stanford's Applied Physics Ph.D. program in 1995 but left to concentrate on his commercial ventures in the solar energy and space sectors.
* ### Tesla continues to concentrate on producing electric vehicles (EV) and their powertrain systems and components as part of its formula for success. The company's network includes 438 stores and galleries, 100 service facilities, and more than 30,000 Superchargers (charging portals) spread across more than 3,100 locations as of 2021.
> # Competive Advantage 
* ### Tesla concentrates on introducing new products that cater to a wider spectrum of customers in order to keep up with the times. Tesla Motors has increased its global operations with locations in the United States and China in order to remain competitive in the specialized market.
 * ### To keep costs down on lithium-ion battery packs, Tesla and key strategic partners, including Panasonic, built a Gigafactory in Nevada that produces the Model 3, battery packs, and energy storage products.
 > # Future Innovation
 * ### Luxury automakers like Mercedes Benz and BMW are entering the burgeoning electric vehicle industry. By 2030, analysts predict that global sales of electric vehicles would account for about 29.5% of all new automobile sales.
